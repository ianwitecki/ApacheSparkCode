1.
  1. The average temperature in 1897 for all stations was 10.7 degrees celsius
     The average temperature in 2016 for all stations was 11.7 degrees celsius

  1. The average temperature in 1897 for all stations reporting temperature data was 10.6 degrees celsius
     The average temperature in 2016 for all stations reporting temperature data was 12.1 degrees celsius

  1.Average Temperature from 1897 to 2017

  1.Average Temperature from 1897 to 2017 from all the same temperature reporting stations

1. The benefit of checking for stations that are reporting weather data throughout the years is that you get consistent locations and the same number of temperatures to pull an average from. This means that every average is equally as accurate as the others.  However, the other method is more accurate for each year because there is more data per year.

1. Yes, the average temperature for 2017 was much larger than any of the average temps. The largest difference for 2017 that was reported was in the hundreds of degrees Celsius. This is obviously wrong. I believe that there may have been some flaws in the 2017 weather set. In a serious analysis I would make line charts of each station and see if there are unusual data trends being reported.
