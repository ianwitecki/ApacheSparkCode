1. I tried to add an extra layer and decrease the number of inputs more gradually between layers. I went from 40 to 20 to 10 to 5. With this method I got 0.49 percent accuracy.

1. I then tried to do an even more gradual change while turning the learning rate down and the number of iterations up. I went from 40 to 20 to 15 to 10 to 5 with a learning rate of 0.01 and a 1500 iterations. My accuracy was 0.5048.

1. I changed the inputs and outputs to 40 to 10 to 8 to 6 to 5 and then I set the learning rate to 0.05 and the number of iterations 2000. When I ran it with these settings, I got 0.5368 percent accuracy.

1. When I ran the program with the settings that I ended with on the previous problem, I got 0.79 percent accuracy.

1. I then took a layer out and went from 40 to 10 to 4 to 2. With the learning rate at 0.01 and the iterations at 2000, the accuracy was 0.81 percent.

1. I decided to take another layer out so that I only had one Dense Layer and one output layer. This changed the input/output to 40 to 5 to 2. I then increased the learning rate to 0.15. The accuracy that I got was 0.8343
