1. Theoretically could be 254,172,331  pairs.
1. There are 2,717,162  actual pairs.
1. The graph of pair terms should not be directed becuase there will never be case where a descriptor has an ed    ge to another descriptor, but there is no edge from that the destination descriptor back. This implies that our gra    ph is only interested in how related different descriptors are to each other.
